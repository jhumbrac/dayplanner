# dayplanner

rendered page: https://jhumbrac.github.io/dayplanner/

In this project I created a day planner geared around the American work week. The calendar is dynamically updated in real time and has a working clock. The goal was to create a quick to do list generator for office tasks. The idea is for the calendar to reset each week but that functionality has not been programmed.
